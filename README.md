# 🚀 AI Builders Club

A group of friends from the **2016 PG batch** regrouped after 9 years exploring **AI Engineering** step by step — together.  
No lectures, no guru-shishya vibes — just **building, sharing, and learning**.

## 🌟 What’s This About?

AI Engineers **integrate AI into real products** using existing models and tools.  
We focus on **practical applications**, not building models from scratch.  

> “**AI Researchers** invent the engine ⚙️, **ML Engineers** fine-tune it 🔧, and **AI Engineers** build Uber 🚕”
