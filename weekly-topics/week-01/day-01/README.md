## 🧠 What / Who is an AI Engineer?

An AI Engineer **uses pre-trained models and existing AI tools to improve user experiences**.  
Key points:

- Focuses on **practical AI applications** instead of building models from scratch  
- Integrates AI into **real-world products**  
- Builds features like **chatbots, search tools, recommendation systems, and AI analytics**  

> Think of it like this:  
> **AI Researchers** invent the car ⚙️  
> **ML Engineers** tune the engine 🔧  
> **AI Engineers** build Uber 🚕

## 🔹 Difference from AI Researchers and ML Engineers

| Role             | Focus                                           | AI Engineer?      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------ |
| **AI Researcher**    | Creates new AI models, publishes papers     | ❌ Not our focus  |
| **ML Engineer**      | Trains, fine-tunes, optimizes models        | ❌ Not main focus |
| **AI Engineer**      | Integrates AI into products, ships features | ✅ That’s us      |

## 🔹 Mindset of an AI Engineer

1. **Integrator > Inventor** → use the right tools/models, don’t reinvent  
2. **Product-first** → AI is a means, not the goal  
3. **Experiment quickly** → prototype, test, fail fast  
4. **Collaborative learning** → share wins and questions

## 🔹 Mini Reflection (Optional)

Take a few minutes and write down:

1. One **AI-powered feature** you’d love to build  
2. One **AI tool or model** you want to try  
3. One **question** about AI Engineering  

> We’ll share these in the group — seeing different perspectives is motivating!
